# Project: Page Rank
## Sage Castiglione

## Introduction
Page Rank was a project that I created as an aside project to be able to catalog a list of words from various "webpages," which take the form of files that are located in the docs directory of this repository. The page rank system uses a series of various data structures that allow for each webpage to be catalouged, then the user can search for words within the system and get them back in order of occurance in the highest page rank document. The graph of the webpage or documents is user created, but an example is provided in the docs repository. 

## Usage
To run the program: 
Open the jar labeled "MobileAgents_SageJake_Final.jar", choose the appropriate map file and observe the forest burn. <Br/><Br/>
There is a second jar: "Sim_Input_Test.jar" This jar file is an earlier version of the program which just reads a config
file and displays the map. This version has no threads.

## Project Assumptions
Assumed in this project was that the input documents would be readible and security would not be an issue. </Br>

## Status
Complete for running on certain systems. 
Incomplete for elinination of memory leaks. 

### Known Issues
It is known that the project will seg-fault on certain systems but run without issue on others, it is known to run on a remote access provided university server but not on a few local laptops.
